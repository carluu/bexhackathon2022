{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Language Understanding\n","\n","Increasingly, we expect computers to be able to use AI in order to understand spoken or typed commands in natural language. For example, you might want to implement a home automation system that enables you to control devices in your home by using voice commands such as \"switch on the light\" or \"put the fan on\", and have an AI-powered device understand the command and take appropriate action.\n","\n","![A robot listening](./images/language_understanding.jpg)\n","\n","## Create Authoring and Prediction Resources\n","\n","Microsoft cognitive services includes the Language Understanding service, which enables you to define *intents* that are applied to *entities* based on *utterances*. \n","\n","To use the Language Understanding service, you need two kinds of resource:\n","\n","- An *authoring* resource: used to define, train, and test the language model. This must be a **Language Understanding - Authoring** resource in your Azure subscription.\n","- A *prediction* resource: used to publish model and handle requests from client applications that use it. This can be either a **Language Understanding** or **Cognitive Services** resource in your Azure subscription.\n","\n","You can use either a **Language Understanding** or  **Cognitive Services** resource to *publish* a Language Understanding app, but you must create a separate **Language Understanding** resource for *authoring* the app.\n","\n","> **Important**: Authoring resources must be created in one of three *regions* (Europe, Australia, or US). Models created in European or Australian authoring resources can only be deployed to prediction resources in Europe or Australia respectively; models created in US authoring resources can be deployed to prediction resources in any Azure location other than Europe and Australia. See the [authoring and publishing regions documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-reference-regions) for details about matching authoring and prediction locations.\n","\n","1.

Wait for the resources to be created, and note that two Language Understanding resources are provisioned; one for authoring, and another for prediction. You can view these by navigating to the resource group where you created them.\n","\n","### Create a Language Understanding App\n","\n","To implement natural language understanding with Language Understanding, you create an app; and then add entities, intents, and utterances to define the commands you want the app to understand:\n","\n","1. In a new browser tab, open the Language Understanding portal for the authoring region where you created your authoring resource:\n","    - US: [https://www.luis.ai](https://www.luis.ai)\n","    - Europe: [https://eu.luis.ai](https://eu.luis.ai)\n","    - Australia: [https://au.luis.ai](https://au.luis.ai)\n","\n","2. Sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription. If this is the first time you have signed into the Language Understanding portal, you may need to grant the app some permissions to access your account details. Then complete the *Welcome* steps by selecting the existing Language Understanding authoring resource you just created in your Azure subscription. \n","\n","3. Open the **Conversation Apps** page, and select your subscription and Language Understanding authoring resource. Then create a new app for conversation with the following settings:\n","   - **Name**: Home Automation\n","   - **Culture**: English (*if this option is not available, leave it blank*)\n","   - **Description**: Simple home automation\n","   - **Prediction resource**: *Your Language Understanding prediction resource*\n","\n","4. If a panel with tips for creating an effective Language Understanding app is displayed, close it.\n","\n","### Create an Entity\n","\n","An *entity* is a thing that your language model can identify and do something with. In this case, your Language Understanding app will be used to control various *devices* in the office, such as lights or fans; so you'll create a *device* entity that includes a list of the types of device that you want the app to work with. For each device type, you'll create a sublist that identifies the name of the device (for example *light*) and any synonyms that might be used to refer to this type of device (for example *lamp*).\n","\n","1. In the Language Understanding page for your app, in the pane on the left, click **Entities**. Then click **Create**, and create a new entity named **device**, select the **List** type, and click **Create**.\n","2. In the **List items** page, under **Normalized Values**, type **light**, then press ENTER.\n","3. After the **light** value has been added, under **Synonyms**, type **lamp** and press ENTER.\n","4. Add a second list item named **fan** with the synonym **AC**.\n","\n","> **Note**: For this lab, use the exact lowercase or uppercase text as instructed _(example: light **not** Light)_ and do not add extra spaces. \n","\n","### Create Intents\n","\n","An *intent* is an action you want to perform on one or more entities - for example, you might want to switch a light on, or turn a fan off. In this case, you'll define two intents: one to switch a device on, and another to switch a device off. For each intent, you'll specify sample *utterances* that indicate the kind of language used to indicate the intent.\n","\n","> **Note**: For this lab, please use the exact lowercase or uppercase text as instructed _(example: \"turn the light on\" **not** \"Turn the light on .\")_ and do not add extra spaces. \n","\n","1. In the pane on the left, click **Intents**. Then click **Create**, and add an intent with the name **switch_on** and click **Done**.\n","2. Under the **Examples** heading and the **Example user input** subheading, type the utterance ***turn the light on*** and press **Enter** to submit this utterance to the list.\n","3. In the *turn the light on* utterance, click the word \"light\", and assign it to the **device** entity's **light** value.\n","\n","![How to assign the word \"light\" to the entity value.](./images/assign_entity.jpg)\n","\n","4. Add a second utterance to the **switch_on** intent, with the phrase ***turn the fan on***. Then assign the word \"fan\" to the **device** entity's **fan** value.\n","5. In the pane on the left, click **Intents** and click **Create**, to add a second intent with the name **switch_off**.\n","6. In the **Utterances** page for the **switch_off** intent, add the utterance ***turn the light off*** and assign the word \"light\" to the **device** entity's **light** value.\n","7. Add a second utterance to the **switch_off** intent, with the phrase ***turn the fan off***. Then connect the word \"fan\" to the **device** entity's **fan** value.\n","\n","### Train and Test the Language Model\n","\n","Now you're ready to use the data you've provided in the form of entities, intents, and utterances to train the language model for your app.\n","\n","1. At the top of the Language Understanding page for your app, click **Train** to train the language model\n","2.

Close the Test pane.\n","    \n","### Publish the Model and Configure Endpoints\n","\n","To use your trained model in a client application, you must publish it as an endpoint to which the client applications can send new utterances; from which intents and entitites will be predicted.\n","\n","1. At the top of the Language Understanding page for your app, click **Publish**. Then select **Production slot** and click **Done**.\n","\n","2.
