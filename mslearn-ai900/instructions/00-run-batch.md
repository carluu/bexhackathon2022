## Get latest files 

1. First we will run a short program that pulls the latest version of the lab files. On the desktop, look for the file **GET_FILES** and double click on it. This will run a command. Once the command runs, the last line will say "Press any key to continue ...". You can close the panel.

2.  Start Visual Studio Code (the program icon is pinned to the bottom taskbar).

3. When it opens, you should see the MSLEARN-AI900 project on the left-hand panel. This folder contains the labs for the course.
